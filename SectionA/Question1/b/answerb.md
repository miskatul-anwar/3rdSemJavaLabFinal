1. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is the ability of different objects to respond in unique ways to the same message or method invocation. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. Polymorphism enables flexibility and extensibility in object-oriented programming by allowing methods to do different things based on the object that they are called on.

2. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It hides the internal state of an object from the outside world and only exposes the necessary features through well-defined interfaces. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction, data hiding, and modularity, thus improving the maintainability and security of code.

3. **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming where a new class (subclass or derived class) is created based on an existing class (superclass or base class). The subclass inherits attributes and behaviors (methods) from its superclass. It promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes, allowing the subclass to extend or override the functionality of the superclass.
