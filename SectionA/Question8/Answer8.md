### Why the `protected` Category is Needed

The `protected` access modifier in Java is used to restrict access to members of a class such that they are accessible within the same package and by subclasses, regardless of whether the subclass is in the same package or not. This is a balance between `private` (accessible only within the same class) and `public` (accessible from anywhere).

### Inheritance and the `protected` Modifier

1. **Inherited as `public`**: When a `protected` member is inherited as `public`, it can be accessed by any class that uses the subclass, essentially promoting the visibility of the member to a broader scope.
2. **Inherited as `private`**: When a `protected` member is inherited as `private`, its visibility is restricted to the subclass only, preventing any external class or even further subclasses from accessing it.

### Java Program Using Inheritance

Here's a Java program that creates a class `Card` to maintain a library card catalog entry with a public member function `store()` to store a book's information and another public member function `show()` to display the information. We will also create a subclass to demonstrate inheritance.

```java
// File: Card.java
public class Card {
    protected String authorName;
    protected String bookEdition;

    // Public method to store book information
    public void store(String authorName, String bookEdition) {
        this.authorName = authorName;
        this.bookEdition = bookEdition;
    }

    // Public method to display book information
    public void show() {
        System.out.println("Author's Name: " + authorName);
        System.out.println("Edition: " + bookEdition);
    }
}

// File: LibraryCard.java
public class LibraryCard extends Card {
    // Additional member for library card
    private String libraryID;

    // Method to store library-specific information
    public void store(String authorName, String bookEdition, String libraryID) {
        super.store(authorName, bookEdition); // Call superclass method to store common info
        this.libraryID = libraryID;
    }

    // Override show method to display library-specific information as well
    @Override
    public void show() {
        super.show(); // Call superclass method to show common info
        System.out.println("Library ID: " + libraryID);
    }
}

// File: Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LibraryCard card = new LibraryCard();
        card.store("J.K. Rowling", "First Edition", "LB123456");
        card.show();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Class `Card`**:

   - This class has `protected` members `authorName` and `bookEdition` to store the author's name and book edition. These are accessible to subclasses and within the same package.
   - The `store` method stores book information.
   - The `show` method displays the stored information.

2. **Class `LibraryCard`**:

   - This subclass extends `Card` and adds an additional member `libraryID`.
   - It overrides the `store` method to also store library-specific information (`libraryID`).
   - It overrides the `show` method to display the library-specific information along with the inherited information.

3. **Main Class**:
   - Creates an instance of `LibraryCard`, stores book information and displays it.

### Expected Output

```
Author's Name: J.K. Rowling
Edition: First Edition
Library ID: LB123456
```

This program demonstrates the use of `protected` members, inheritance, and method overriding. The `LibraryCard` class inherits `protected` members from `Card` and provides additional functionality specific to the library context.
