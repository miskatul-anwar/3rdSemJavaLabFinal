The provided code has the following issues:

1. **Missing Output Statement**:

   - **Problem**: The method `addTwoNumbers` is called but its return value is not used or printed.
   - **Solution**: Store the result in a variable or directly print it.

2. **Package Declaration and Separation**:

   - **Problem**: The code segments for `Test3` and `Test1` are placed together in a way that doesn't clearly separate the packages `p1` and `p2`.
   - **Solution**: Ensure each class is correctly placed in its own file within the appropriate package directory.

3. **File Naming and Placement**:
   - **Problem**: Java classes in packages must be placed in corresponding directories. For example, `Test3` should be in a file named `Test3.java` inside a `p1` directory, and `Test1` should be in a file named `Test1.java` inside a `p2` directory.
   - **Solution**: Place each class in the correct directory structure.

### Corrected Code

#### File: `p1/Test3.java`

```java
package p1;

public class Test3 {
  int addTwoNumbers(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}
```

#### File: `p2/Test1.java`

```java
package p2;

import p1.Test3;

public class Test1 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Test3 obj = new Test3();
    int result = obj.addTwoNumbers(10, 21);
    System.out.println("Sum: " + result);
  }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Package Declaration**:

   - Each class file begins with the appropriate `package` declaration.

2. **Import Statement**:

   - `p2.Test1` imports `p1.Test3` to use the `Test3` class.

3. **Printing the Result**:

   - The result of `addTwoNumbers` is stored in the variable `result` and then printed.

4. **Directory Structure**:
   - Ensure the directory structure matches the package names:
     ```
     project_root/
     ├── p1/
     │   └── Test3.java
     └── p2/
         └── Test1.java
     ```

By addressing these issues, the code will compile and run correctly, producing the expected output:

```
Sum: 31
```
